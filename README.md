# NewYork AirBnb Case Study Machine Learning

**Airbnb Listing Clustering Project**

This project aims to enhance the user experience and efficiency of Airbnb services in New York City by providing personalized recommendations to users. The goal is to develop a clustering model that groups Airbnb listings based on various features and characteristics, allowing for more tailored recommendations and improved customer satisfaction.

**Business Objective:**
- Enhance user experience and efficiency of Airbnb services in New York City.
- Provide personalized recommendations to users based on clustering of Airbnb listings.
  
**Desired Outcome:**
- Develop a clustering model that groups Airbnb listings into meaningful clusters.
- Offer personalized recommendations to users by leveraging the clustering model.
  
**Problem Statement:**
- Develop a clustering model using features like 'latitude', 'longitude', 'room_type', 'price', etc.
- Identify meaningful clusters representing various types of Airbnb listings.
  
**Key Objectives:**
- Identify meaningful clusters representing different types of listings.
- Provide personalized recommendations to users based on clustering results.
- Enhance search and filtering functionalities on the Airbnb platform.
- Optimize business operations and increase customer satisfaction.
  
**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Evaluate clustering model performance using silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, or domain-specific criteria.
  
**Implementation:**
- Implement clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) based on provided features.
- Fine-tune model and integrate into Airbnb platform for real-time recommendations.

By achieving the desired outcome, Airbnb aims to provide a more personalized experience for users, increase successful bookings, and optimize business operations based on a deeper understanding of listing characteristics.
